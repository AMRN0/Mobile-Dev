# Mobile-Dev
This is the repo for my final year mobile game development.

## Game Idea
The game idea is to have a ball in a space rolling towards a goal. There will be enemies coming towards the player and the player needs to avoid them in order to reach the goal. The game is currently an endless runner.
The app uses the phones camera to take pictures that the user can choose and uses them as textures for the enemies.

The user can use touch controls and gyro to move left or right, the camera will create enemy textures, and the haptic feedback inside the phones will vibrate on each obstacle collision and powerup collection.

## UI and UX Game Elements
The player will have a lives counter which goes down each hit.
Background music will be playing in the background to keep the user engaged.
Premimssions to use the camera app and phone storage will be needed to make the app function.
Minimal ads will be integrated to not distract the user from the game. These can be removed through in-app purchases.
The background image is a skybox that will be controlled by the weather app using the weather API.
The game will store the players settings and high score, so the player feels motivated to play the game and beat their own score.

## Controls
There wont be a physical or on screen button to press for the player to move. If the user taps on the left side of the player moves left, similarly for moving right.
There is also the option to use gyro by default.

## Difficulty
The difficulty of the game can be set by the player at the start of the game and can be changed in the main menu.

## Frameworks
Unity URP: for better looking game with less hit to performance.
Weather API: changing skybox based on weather.
Candy Coded: for haptic feedback.
Camera API: for textures on enemies.
Ad Monetisation: For in-app purchases and ads.
Accelerometer: for accurate gyro controls.
