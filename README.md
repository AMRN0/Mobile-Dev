# Mobile-Dev
This is the repo for my final year mobile game development.

## Game Idea
The game idea is to have a ball or object in a space running towards a goal.
The app uses the phones camera to scan the space around the player and replicates those objects in the game.
Those objects will be used as obstacles and will act as enemies to stop the player from reaching their destination or goal.

The idea is to use machine learning to detect real life objects and depending on the identification, that object's prefab will spawn into the game. If the camera cannot detct anything, a random object within the list will spawn to keep the game running.
The user can use touch controls to move left or right, the camera will detect objects in real life, and the haptic feedback inside the phones will vibrate on each obstacle collision and point collection.

## UI and UX Game Elements
The player will have a health bar which goes down each hit. (health yet to be decided)
Background music will be playing in the background to keep the user engaged.
Premimssions to use the camera app and phone storage will be needed to make the app function.
Minimal ads will be integrated to not distract the user from the game.
The background image might be the player running down a road, with houses along the side.

## Controls
There wont be a physical or on screen button to press for the player to move. If the user taps on the left side of the player moves left, similarly for moving right.


## Difficulty
The difficulty of the game will gradually increase as time goes on, with faster spawning moving obstacles.
